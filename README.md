# Welcome to Graphlets-Hub

**The Graphlets-Hub is a free, open-source and community-driven knowledge base and documentation initiative on [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com "The Graph Protocol") kickstarted by The Graph Academy.**

The goal of The Graph Academy is to establish a go-to-resource for essential information about The Graph Protocol. It is our vision to jointly build a vast knowledge base that empowers community members to master The Graph and to excel as participants in the protocol.

We seek to create this single source of essential information on The Graph through the following community initiatives:

1. [The Graph Academy](https://thegraph.academy/ "The Graph Academy") for hands-on, interactive tutorials and detailed guidesÂ´as well as news and discussions on recent developments in the The Graph ecosystem and much more 
2. [The Graphlets-Hub](https://github.com/TheGraphAcademy/Graphlets-Hub/ "The Graphlets-Hub") for detailed documentation from the figureheads and experts in The Graph community as well as everyone else who likes to participate
3. [The monthly Graphtronauts Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/graph-community-podcast "The Graphtronauts Podcast") with exciting interviews and in-depth discussions on the protocol we all have come to love so much
4. [Graphlets Monthly Newsletter](https://thegraph.academy/ "Graphlets Monthly Newsletter") with insightful updates about The Graph and community initiatives in the ecosystem to keep you up to date

You are now in the Docs section which is the core of The Graph Academy. The documentation is hosted on GitHub and made freely available as open source. This means that anyone in the community is able to contribute to this documentation. Doing so allows this initiative to keep the community-driven information unbiased, up to date and concise.

If you're new to The Graph Protocol, you can learn more about it in this introduction: [What the Graph Is](https://thegraph.com/docs/introduction#what-the-graph-is "What the Graph Is")
