# Welcome to Graphlets-Hub

**The Graphlets-Hub is a free, open-source and community-driven knowledge base and documentation initiative on [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com "The Graph Protocol") kickstarted by The Graph Academy.**

The goal of The Graph Academy is to establish a go-to-resource for essential information about The Graph Protocol. It is our vision to jointly build a vast knowledge base that empowers community members to master The Graph and to excel as participants in the protocol.

We seek to create this single source of essential information on The Graph through the following community initiatives:

1. [The Graph Academy](https://thegraph.academy/ "The Graph Academy") for hands-on, interactive tutorials and detailed guides, news around The Graph and much more 
2. [The Graphlets-Hub](https://github.com/TheGraphAcademy/Graphlets-Hub/ "The Graphlets-Hub") for detailed documentation from the figureheads and experts in The Graph community
3. [The monthly Graphtronauts Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/graph-community-podcast "The Graphtronauts Podcast") with exciting interviews and in-depth discussions
