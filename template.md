# Hello fellow contributor, we're glad to have you! 
Please use this template as a guide when creating pages for the Graphlets-Hub.

All pages use Markdown (a cheat sheet for this can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)) so be sure to use `.md` as the extension when creating the page file. If you do not wish to use markdown, you can also use [Editor.md](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html "Editor.md") a open-source online markdown editor.
